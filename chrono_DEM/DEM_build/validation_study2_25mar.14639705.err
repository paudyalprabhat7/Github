WARNING! Some clumps do not have their family numbers specified, so defaulted to 0


WARNING! At least one clump is initialized with a position out of the box domian you specified.
It is found at 0.378, 0, 0.076383 (this message only shows one such example).
This simulation is unlikely to go as planned.

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  System max velocity is 61066.52, exceeded max allowance (20000).
If this velocity is not abnormal and you want to increase this allowance, use SetErrorOutVelocity before initializing simulation.
Otherwise, the simulation may have diverged and relaxing the physics may help, such as decreasing the step size and modifying material properties.
This happened in unpackMyBuffer.
