  what():  On average a sphere has 108.2126 contacts, more than the max allowance (100).
If you believe this is not abnormal, set the allowance high using SetErrorOutAvgContacts before initialization.
If you think this is because dT drifting too much ahead of kT so the contact margin added is too big, use SetCDMaxUpdateFreq to limit the max dT future drift.
Otherwise, the simulation may have diverged and relaxing the physics may help, such as decreasing the step size and modifying material properties.
This happened in contactDetection.
